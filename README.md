# Off_Hand
I made this project for an artist their end project.
Off Hand is a game made for dutch children. The game is all about spelling dutch words correctly. You walk your way through the city and encounter multiple hordes that attack you. As the player you must spell the words correctly in order to defeat them and work your way  to the third level.

This game was made in a time period off three weeks. In these 3 weeks I also helped another artist and created another game for android and pc.
